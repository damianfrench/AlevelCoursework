this code doesnt currently work but was my year long attempt to write a seech recognition alogrithm.

the idea was to record the sound the user makes, and using a fourier analysis split up small sections of it into freqencies.
by having the size of these sections correspond with the average size of a phoneme in human language, I would then compare the frequencies
in that phoneme with pre-recorded frequencies that I created of my speaking each phoneme.

if this repo is used, take the files titled styles and scripts and add them to a folder called static, then take the .html files and the jpeg
files and add them to a folder templates.
